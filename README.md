# Amelia 2.0.0
A desktop chatbot made in Python.

Finally!! this is the project which I had been planning since months and was sitting half complete in my files. I finally upgraded it from a CLI based chatbot to a GUI based
chatbot. It is made using the Tkinter library and uses [RandomStuff API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-stuff-api) for the chatbot. Obviously I haven't made that, you can visit the official developer of the API here, [PGamerX](https://github.com/pgamerx). I am planning a lot for this app, you can expect minigames or other features in the future updates, I had a web searching feature planned but delayed it because it needed a lot of work. Even you can contribute to this project if you want ðŸ˜‰
